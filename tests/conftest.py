"""Shared fixtures for the system and bet-progress test suites.

This file is the single source of truth for service discovery and state
management. Both tests/system/ and tests/bets/ import from here.

Services and their ports/DBs are DISCOVERED at runtime by parsing the
workspace docker-compose.yml — there are no hardcoded ports and no
manifest file. Adding a service to the workspace automatically brings
it under test.

FAIL LOUD, NOT SILENT: when GROUNDWORK_REQUIRE_SERVICES=1 (set by CI and
by `./dev test integration`), an unreachable service is a FAILURE. Locally
(flag unset) the same condition skips, so the inner loop stays ergonomic.
